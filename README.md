This notebook shows the lifecyce of Data Science project with machine learning approach.

The Project is a part of Data Science Coding Challenge from coursera.

The main goal of the project is to  predict which individuals are at the highest risk of defaulting on their loans, so that proper interventions can be effectively deployed to the right audience. Machine Learning approaches can be employed to tackle this problem.
